- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Linear Regression Model (embedded in JavaScript)
- R² Score: 0.66

### Flask Backend (Optional)
- Python 3.12+
- Flask 3.0
- scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- R² Score: 0.80

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | R² Score | RMSE |
|-------|----------|------|
| Random Forest (Flask) | 0.80 | 13.27 |
| Linear Regression (JS) | 0.66 | ~18.5 |

## 🏃 Running Locally

### Option 1: Static Website (Simple)
Just open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No server required!

### Option 2: Flask Backend (More Accurate)

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Flask app:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
